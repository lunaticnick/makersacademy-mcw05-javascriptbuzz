# FizzBuzz using Javascript

The goal of Fizzbuzz is to introduce you to Test Driven Development (TDD) and also it is one of the first programs that someone writes when learning a new language.
So this is the implementation in Javascript.

## Specifications of Fizzbuzz
- The program can be passed a number.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
- In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.


## How to Play
First clone the directory to your local drive & navigate to the folder that contains the game, by doing the following:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lunaticnick/makersacademy-mcw05-javascriptbuzz.git local_directory

```

In order to play the game you will need to open ```SpecRunner.html``` located in root and then to use the developer console of your favourite browser.
